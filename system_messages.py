Write and execute python code to perform a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with the following steps:
1. Basic Inspection: Display the first few rows, check data types, and identify missing values.
2. Statistical Summary: Generate summary statistics using `df.describe()`.
3. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency.
4. Feature Engineering: Create or modify features as needed.
5. Save the cleaned dataset to the dataset directory.
7. Also make sure all the outputs for above steps are printed
6. Store all the outputs to `insights.txt` in the dataset directory.
7. Write "code89298' print statement in the code which should only execute after all above steps are done scuessfully
Next task
1.When you receive the detailed analysis of EDA write a Python code for making another txt  for the detailed analysis to dataset\\insights_analysis.txt
reply TERMINATE only when you get the confirmation of code execution
